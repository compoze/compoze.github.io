# Compoze Platform

Compoze is a SaaS-based infrastructure management and Platform Ops tool that enables your teams to build production applications in minutes. Compoze makes it easy to build Performant, Secure, Cost Effective, Operationally Excellent, and Reliable applications on AWS. Compoze is built with two core tenants:

1. AWS Golden Template
2. Service Catalog

## Golden Template

In order to even begin to deploy applications within AWS, there are core foundational services that must be setup in order to ensure your applications are production-grade. Creating thse core AWS services involves a comprehensive approach to ensure operational excellence, cost optimization, security, performance, and reliability are maintained. The work required to achieve this includes:

1. **Operational Excellence:** This involves setting up processes and tools to manage the day-to-day operations of the services. This includes tasks such as setting up automation, monitoring, logging, and alerting.

2. **Cost Optimization:** This involves controlling and reducing the cost of running the services. This can include cost allocation tagging, reserved instances, and cost analysis.

3. **Security:** This involves implementing security measures to protect data and systems. This can include access controls, network security, encryption, and identity and access management.

4. **Performance:** This involves optimizing the performance of the services. This can include using the right instance types, auto scaling, and proper load balancing.

5. **Reliability:** This involves ensuring the services are available and reliable. This can include setting up disaster recovery, auto healing, and multi-availability zone deployments.

Normally, each of these areas requires a combination of planning, development, testing, and deployment activities. The teams involved may include developers, operations, security, and infrastructure teams. Ongoing maintenance and updates are also required to ensure that the services continue to meet the goals of operational excellence, cost optimization, security, performance, and reliability.

Compoze will configure, maintain, and operate the AWS Services necessary to give you the proper foundation to build your applications
